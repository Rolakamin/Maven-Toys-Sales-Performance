## Introduction

**Maven Toys**, a fictional chain of toy stores in Mexico, is planning to expand its business by opening new stores. To support this effort, I was hired as a Business Intelligence (BI) consultant to analyze their sales and inventory data, uncover patterns and trends, and provide actionable insights for informed decision-making.

Using data from January 2022 to September 2023, I evaluated key performance indicators (KPIs) such as revenue, profit, and units sold, alongside trends in monthly revenue and units sold over time, as well as product and store performance. With an annual revenue target of $8.5 million for both 2022 and 2023, the project focuses on assessing the company’s progress toward these goals while identifying top-performing and underperforming stores and locations.

To present these insights effectively, I developed a single-page interactive dashboard in Power BI, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions and shape their expansion strategy.

## Project Overview 

Maven Toys, a fictional chain of toy stores in Mexico, seeks to expand its operations by opening new stores. An analysis of sales and inventory data from January 2022 to September 2023 provides key insights into patterns and trends, which will guide the company's expansion strategy.

### Business Objectives

The main objective of Maven Toys is to expand its business by opening new stores. To make informed decisions about where to open new locations, the company relies on data-driven insights derived from sales and inventory data.

### Business Problems

To achieve its expansion goals, Maven Toys needs to address the following key questions:

•	What is the Year-over-Year (YoY) growth in revenue, profit, and units sold? How did Maven Toys perform in the previous year?
•	Maven Toys has set a target of $8.5 million in revenue for each year — 2022 and 2023. How much progress has been made toward this goal by evaluating Year-to-Date (YTD) and Previous-Year-to-Date (PYTD) growth?
•	Which product categories drive the biggest profits? Is this consistent across store locations?
•	Which store locations have the highest potential for profitability?
•	Can seasonal trends or patterns in sales data be identified that might affect the timing and location of new store openings?
•	Which stores are top performers in terms of revenue and profit?
