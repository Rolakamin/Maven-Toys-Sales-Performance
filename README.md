## Introduction

**Maven Toys**, a fictional chain of toy stores in Mexico, is planning to expand its business by opening new stores. To support this effort, I was hired as a Business Intelligence (BI) consultant to analyze their sales and inventory data, uncover patterns and trends, and provide actionable insights for informed decision-making.

Using data from January 2022 to September 2023, I evaluated key performance indicators (KPIs) such as revenue, profit, and units sold, alongside trends in monthly revenue and units sold over time, as well as product and store performance. With an annual revenue target of $8.5 million for both 2022 and 2023, the project focuses on assessing the companyâ€™s progress toward these goals while identifying top-performing and underperforming stores and locations.

To present these insights effectively, I developed a single-page interactive dashboard in Power BI, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions and shape their expansion strategy.
